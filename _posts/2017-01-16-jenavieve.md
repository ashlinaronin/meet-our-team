age 31

products: teacup

she always starts out every convo by giving compliments to the customer and making them feel like there is a powerful energy in the sales relationship that, who knows, could maybe lead to something. at times, her strategy verges on inappropriate but sh’s usually able to keep it under control. she asks lots of leading questions with readily implied answers, but is so complimentary that she can be diarming despite this sometimes heavy-handed approach. lines include ‘i know this product would make you absolutely unstoppable’, ‘when my husband got this one, it really turned things around for us.’ loves to follow up with customers (separate node process for followups, e.g bens nsr webjob) at inopportune times - e.g. text just before bedtime.
